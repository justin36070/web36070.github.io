        <h2>Topic and Scope: System to manage an online library system for an educational institution</h2>
    <p>The library at school has been manually managing the lending of books to students at school but is now facing problems because the administration is too much and using a book to record the students’ lending books has become inefficient and they can no longer keep track of the books thus books have gone missing and cannot be retrieved because they don’t know who has them. A library needs to know what books were taken out who took them out, what day and when these books were returned and if fines where paid. where book is placed on alpha numeric shelf.</p>
    <p>I will write a program using a database to organise all the data that can no longer be managed in a paperback book. The program will allow the efficient access to the records of who has borrowed books. This will allow the librarian to keep track of who owes books to the library and thereby maintain the library inventory and fine those who fail to return books on time. This program will only perform the basic requirements to fulfil the admin needs of the library. Manage books returned, borrowed and in stock </p>
